# Happy Birthday Mom

Setting up a little birthday card for Mom. She doesn't like giraffes, but it's a family tradition to give them to her.

Since I have windows, and prefer developing on Linux, this is run in a docker container.

`yarn run dev` - Start the site up on a dev server
`yarn run prod` - Package the site for deployment to github sites
`yarn run clean` - Clean the dist and docs directories.
